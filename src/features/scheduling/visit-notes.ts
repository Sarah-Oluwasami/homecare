/**
 * The visit's Notes tab, as a view over records that already exist.
 *
 * Two things end up in one list:
 *
 *  - notes people wrote, from the client's care notes, filtered to this
 *    visit's window;
 *  - entries the *record* produced — the clock-in, the clock-out, the
 *    medication rounds — which are read straight off `timelineFor`, so the
 *    Notes tab and the Timeline tab cannot describe the same visit differently.
 *
 * Nothing here is stored against a visit. The app has no note-to-visit link, no
 * threading, no acknowledgement state and no read receipts, so this module
 * offers no reply, no acknowledge and no flag — the source design had all
 * three on every row.
